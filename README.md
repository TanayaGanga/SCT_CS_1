This is my Task 1 of cybersecurity . This uses the Caesar cipher algorithm to encrypt and decrypt text. This program should prompt users to input a message and specify a shift value, which determines the number of positions each letter will move in the alphabet. Users can choose to either encrypt the message, shifting letters forward by the specified amount, or decrypt it, shifting letters backward to retrieve the original text. The program should handle both uppercase and lowercase letters, ensuring non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged. This  will allow users to easily encode and decode messages based on their chosen shift value.
